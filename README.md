# enigma-rust

This is an implementation of an Enigma machine, in Rust.
I did it mostly to practice Rust.

Greatly inspired from [https://github.com/mikepound/enigma](https://github.com/mikepound/enigma)

## TODO
- improve error handling, especially error type in Plugboard and Reflector
- add unit tests!
- change bin.rs to read from stdin

## Tips
